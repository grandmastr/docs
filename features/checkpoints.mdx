title: Checkpoints
---

Checkpoints automatically save snapshots of your workspace after each step in a task, allowing you to track changes, roll back when needed, and experiment confidently with your code.

## How Checkpoints Work

Elastic Copilot creates a checkpoint after each tool use (file edits, commands, browser actions, etc.). These checkpoints:

- Work alongside your Git workflow without interference
- Maintain context between restores
- Use a shadow Git repository to track changes
- Store snapshots in VS Code's global storage

For example, if you're working on a feature and Elastic Copilot makes multiple file changes, each change creates a checkpoint. This means you can review each modification and, if needed, roll back to any point without affecting your main Git repository.

## Shadow Git System

Checkpoints use an innovative shadow Git repository system:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Isolated Tracking">
    Creates a separate Git repository that tracks your workspace without interfering with your main Git repo
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smart Exclusions">
    Automatically excludes build artifacts, dependencies, and large files from checkpoint tracking
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How It Works

1. **Shadow Repository**: A separate `.git` directory is created in VS Code's global storage
2. **Workspace Linking**: The shadow repo is configured to track your actual workspace files
3. **Automatic Commits**: Each checkpoint creates a commit in the shadow repository
4. **File Filtering**: Intelligent exclusion of irrelevant files (node_modules, build outputs, etc.)

## Viewing Changes & Restoring

After each tool use, you can:

### Compare Changes
- Click the **Compare** button to see modified files
- View detailed diffs of what changed at each step
- Review the complete history of modifications

### Restore Options
Click the **Restore** button next to any step to choose from three options:

#### Restore Task and Workspace
- Resets both codebase and task conversation to that point
- Reverts all file changes made after the checkpoint
- Removes conversation history after the selected step
- **Use when**: You want to start fresh from a specific point

#### Restore Task Only
- Keeps codebase changes but reverts task context
- Deletes conversation messages after the checkpoint
- Preserves all file modifications
- **Use when**: You want to try different prompts but keep the code changes

#### Restore Workspace Only
- Resets codebase while preserving task context
- Reverts files to the checkpoint state
- Keeps the full conversation history
- **Use when**: You want to attempt different implementations while preserving the discussion

## Use Cases

Checkpoints enable more experimental development with AI assistance:

### Safety Net for Auto-Approve Mode
- Provides confidence when using auto-approve features
- Easy to undo unexpected results
- Allows rapid iteration without fear of breaking changes

### Testing Different Approaches
- Try multiple solutions confidently
- Compare different implementations side-by-side
- Quickly revert to working states
- Ideal for exploring different design patterns or architectural approaches

### Code Experimentation
- Test aggressive refactoring approaches
- Try experimental features without risk
- Rollback partial implementations that don't work out

## Best Practices

### Strategic Checkpoint Usage
- Use checkpoints as safety nets when experimenting
- Leverage auto-approve mode more confidently, knowing you can always roll back
- Create natural breakpoints in complex tasks

### Choosing Restore Types
- **"Restore Task and Workspace"** for a complete fresh start
- **"Restore Task Only"** to try different prompts while keeping file changes
- **"Restore Workspace Only"** to attempt different implementations while preserving conversation context

### Workflow Integration
- Checkpoints complement your regular Git workflow
- Use for AI-assisted development phases
- Regular Git commits for finalized features

## Configuration

### Enabling/Disabling Checkpoints
Checkpoints can be controlled through VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "elasticCopilot.enableCheckpoints": true
}
```

### Requirements
- **Git**: Must be installed and available in your system PATH
- **Workspace**: Must be working within a VS Code workspace (not individual files)
- **Directory Restrictions**: Cannot be used in home, Desktop, Documents, or Downloads directories

## Technical Details

### Storage Location
Checkpoints are stored in VS Code's global storage:
```
<VS Code Global Storage>/tasks/<task-id>/checkpoints/
```

### File Exclusions
The system automatically excludes:
- Build artifacts (dist/, build/, out/)
- Dependencies (node_modules/, vendor/)
- Cache files (*.cache, .eslintcache)
- Large media files (*.mp4, *.zip, etc.)
- Environment files (.env*)
- IDE files (.vscode/, .idea/)

### Relationship with Message Editing
The message editing feature uses checkpoints when you select the "Restore All" option, allowing you to edit and resubmit messages while restoring your workspace to that conversation point.

## Managing Checkpoints

### Deletion
- Checkpoints are automatically cleaned up when tasks are deleted
- Use "Delete All History" to remove all tasks and their checkpoints
- Individual checkpoints cannot be deleted (they're tied to conversation steps)

### Performance
- Checkpoints are created asynchronously to avoid blocking development
- Only tracks relevant files to minimize storage overhead
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files and excluded content

The checkpoint system provides a powerful safety net that encourages experimentation and rapid iteration while maintaining the ability to recover from any unwanted changes or explore alternative approaches.
