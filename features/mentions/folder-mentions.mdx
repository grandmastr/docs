Folder mentions let you reference entire directories using `@/path/to/folder/` syntax. When you mention a folder, Elastic sees the complete directory structure and all file contents, perfect for understanding complex interactions between multiple files.

## How Folder Mentions Work

When you type `@` in the chat input and navigate to folders, Elastic shows you:

- **Directory structure**: Complete folder hierarchy
- **File listings**: All files within the folder
- **Nested folders**: Subdirectories and their contents

## Syntax

```
@/path/to/folder/
```

Examples:
- `@/src/components/`
- `@/utils/`
- `@/api/auth/`
- `@/tests/`

## What Elastic Sees

When you mention a folder, Elastic receives:

1. **Complete directory structure** - All files and subfolders
2. **All file contents** - Every file within the folder
3. **Relationships** - How files interact and depend on each other
4. **Architecture patterns** - Organizational structure and conventions

## Best Practices

### When to Use Folder Mentions

- **Architecture review**: `@/src/components/ How is this component library organized?`
- **Feature analysis**: `@/api/auth/ Explain the authentication system`
- **Testing**: `@/tests/ Run through the test coverage`
- **Documentation**: `@/docs/ Update the documentation structure`

### Combining with File Mentions

Mix folder and file mentions for comprehensive context:

```
@/src/components/ @/src/styles/components.css 
The component styling system needs refactoring
```

### Multiple Folder Mentions

Reference multiple directories to show relationships:

```
@/frontend/components/ @/backend/api/ 
How do these frontend components connect to the backend?
```

## Folder Types and Use Cases

### Source Code Directories
```
@/src/
@/lib/
@/components/
```
Perfect for understanding code organization and architecture.

### Configuration Directories
```
@/config/
@/.github/
@/scripts/
```
Ideal for setup, deployment, and automation questions.

### Documentation Directories
```
@/docs/
@/examples/
@/guides/
```
Great for documentation updates and examples.

### Test Directories
```
@/tests/
@/__tests__/
@/spec/
```
Excellent for test coverage and quality assurance.

## Tips for Effective Folder Mentions

1. **Use trailing slash**: Always end with `/` to indicate a folder
2. **Be strategic**: Large folders might overwhelm the context
3. **Combine wisely**: Mix with specific file mentions for focus
4. **Consider scope**: Start with smaller folders for targeted questions
5. **Think hierarchically**: Use parent/child folder relationships

## Integration with Memory Bank

Folder mentions help Elastic understand:

- **Project architecture**: How you organize code
- **Naming conventions**: Your folder and file naming patterns
- **Dependency patterns**: How different parts of your project connect
- **Development workflow**: Your preferred project structure

## Common Use Cases

### Architecture Analysis
```
@/src/
Can you analyze the overall architecture of this application?
```

### Feature Development
```
@/api/users/ 
Add role-based permissions to the user management system
```

### Code Organization
```
@/components/ 
Help me reorganize these components by feature
```

### Migration Planning
```
@/legacy/ @/modern/ 
Plan the migration from legacy to modern architecture
```

### Testing Strategy
```
@/tests/unit/ @/tests/integration/ 
Review the testing strategy and coverage
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Large folders**: Very large directories might be truncated
- **Deep nesting**: Deeply nested structures might be simplified
- **File limits**: Folders with many files might show summaries
- **Binary files**: Non-text files are typically excluded

## Combining with Other Mentions

Folder mentions work excellently with:

- **Problem mentions**: `@/src/components/ @problems Fix all component errors`
- **Terminal mentions**: `@/build/ @terminal Why is the build failing?`
- **Git mentions**: `@/src/ @git-changes Review the recent changes`

Folder mentions provide the broadest context for understanding how different parts of your project work together, making them essential for architectural discussions and large-scale refactoring.
