description: "Share recent terminal output with complete formatting and context"

Terminal mentions let you reference your recent terminal output using `@terminal`. When you mention terminal output, Elastic sees the complete output with formatting preserved, perfect for debugging build errors, test failures, or command results.

## How Terminal Mentions Work

When you type `@terminal` in the chat input, Elastic automatically captures:

- **Recent terminal output** - The last several lines of terminal activity
- **Command history** - What commands were executed
- **Error messages** - Complete error output and stack traces
- **Formatting** - Colors, indentation, and structure preserved
- **Context** - Working directory and environment information

## Syntax

```
@terminal
```

Simple and automatic - just type `@terminal` and Elastic will include your recent terminal output.

## What Elastic Sees

When you mention terminal output, Elastic receives:

1. **Complete output** - All recent terminal text
2. **Command context** - What commands were run
3. **Error details** - Full error messages and stack traces
4. **Formatting** - Original colors and structure
5. **Timestamps** - When commands were executed
6. **Working directory** - Current path context

## Best Practices

### When to Use Terminal Mentions

- **Build errors**: `@terminal The build is failing with these errors`
- **Test failures**: `@terminal Tests are not passing`
- **Command help**: `@terminal What does this error mean?`
- **Installation issues**: `@terminal Package installation failed`
- **Script debugging**: `@terminal My script isn't working correctly`

### Combining with File Mentions

Connect terminal output to specific files:

```
@terminal @/package.json 
The npm install is failing
```

### Combining with Problem Mentions

Get comprehensive debugging context:

```
@terminal @problems 
The build errors match these workspace problems
```

## Types of Terminal Output

### Build Output
- Compilation results
- Bundling information
- Asset generation
- Error messages

### Test Results
- Test suite execution
- Pass/fail status
- Coverage reports
- Performance metrics

### Package Management
- Installation logs
- Dependency resolution
- Version conflicts
- Registry issues

### Git Operations
- Commit messages
- Merge conflicts
- Branch operations
- Push/pull results

### Development Servers
- Server startup logs
- Request/response info
- Error messages
- Performance data

## Common Terminal Scenarios

### Build Failures
```
@terminal 
The TypeScript compilation is failing
```

### Test Debugging
```
@terminal 
These test failures don't make sense
```

### Installation Problems
```
@terminal 
I can't install this package
```

### Server Issues
```
@terminal 
The development server won't start
```

### Git Conflicts
```
@terminal 
I'm having trouble with this merge
```

## Tips for Effective Terminal Mentions

1. **Capture immediately**: Use `@terminal` right after seeing errors
2. **Include context**: Mention what you were trying to do
3. **Show the command**: Include the command that caused the issue
4. **Be specific**: Ask about particular error messages
5. **Combine mentions**: Use with relevant file or folder mentions

## Integration with Memory Bank

Terminal mentions help Elastic learn:

- **Common commands**: Your frequently used terminal commands
- **Error patterns**: Recurring issues and their solutions
- **Development workflow**: How you use the terminal
- **Environment setup**: Your development environment preferences

## Advanced Use Cases

### Debugging Complex Builds
```
@terminal @/webpack.config.js 
The webpack build is producing strange output
```

### Performance Analysis
```
@terminal 
These performance metrics look concerning
```

### Environment Issues
```
@terminal 
Something is wrong with my development environment
```

### Deployment Problems
```
@terminal 
The deployment script is failing
```

### Database Operations
```
@terminal 
The database migration didn't work
```

## Combining with Other Mentions

### With File Mentions
```
@terminal @/src/server.js 
The server file is causing these errors
```

### With Folder Mentions
```
@terminal @/tests/ 
All the tests in this folder are failing
```

### With Problem Mentions
```
@terminal @problems 
The terminal errors match these workspace diagnostics
```

### With Git Mentions
```
@terminal @git-changes 
My recent changes are causing build failures
```

## Terminal Output Limitations

### Output Length
- Very long output might be truncated
- Elastic focuses on the most recent and relevant lines
- Ask for specific parts if needed

### Binary Output
- Non-text output is typically excluded
- Binary files and data are filtered out
- Focus on text-based terminal output

### Sensitive Information
- Be careful with terminal output containing:
  - API keys or passwords
  - Personal information
  - Internal system details

## Troubleshooting Terminal Mentions

### No Terminal Output
If `@terminal` shows nothing:
- Make sure you've run commands recently
- Check if the terminal is active
- Try running a simple command first
- Verify terminal integration is working

### Incomplete Output
If output seems truncated:
- Ask for specific error messages
- Use file mentions to show relevant code
- Break down complex issues into smaller parts
- Focus on the most critical error lines

### Formatting Issues
If formatting is lost:
- Mention specific error codes or messages
- Describe what you were trying to do
- Use quotes around specific error text
- Ask Elastic to focus on particular lines

Terminal mentions are invaluable for debugging and getting help with command-line issues, making them essential for development workflow support and troubleshooting.
