URL mentions let you reference web content using `@https://example.com` syntax. When you mention a URL, Elastic fetches and sees the complete webpage content, perfect for referencing documentation, GitHub issues, Stack Overflow answers, or any online resource.

## How URL Mentions Work

When you type `@` followed by a URL in the chat input, Elastic:

- **Fetches the webpage** - Downloads the complete content
- **Parses the content** - Extracts text, code, and structure
- **Preserves formatting** - Maintains important formatting and structure
- **Includes metadata** - Title, description, and other relevant information

## Syntax

```
@https://example.com
@http://example.com
@https://example.com/path/to/page
```

Examples:
- `@https://docs.react.dev/learn/getting-started`
- `@https://github.com/user/repo/issues/123`
- `@https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12345`
- `@https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API`

## What Elastic Sees

When you mention a URL, Elastic receives:

1. **Complete webpage content** - All text and code on the page
2. **Page title and metadata** - SEO and descriptive information
3. **Structured content** - Headers, lists, code blocks, and formatting
4. **Links and references** - Related resources and navigation
5. **Code examples** - Syntax-highlighted code snippets
6. **Documentation structure** - Organized information hierarchy

## Best Practices

### When to Use URL Mentions

- **Documentation reference**: `@https://docs.example.com How do I implement this?`
- **Issue tracking**: `@https://github.com/user/repo/issues/123 Help with this bug`

## Tips for Effective URL Mentions

1. **Use specific URLs**: Link to exact pages, not just homepages
2. **Include context**: Explain what you want to do with the content
3. **Combine strategically**: Mix with file mentions for implementation
4. **Check accessibility**: Ensure URLs are publicly accessible
5. **Be patient**: Large pages might take time to fetch

## URL Mention Limitations

### Content Accessibility
- **Authentication required**: Some pages need login
- **Paywalls**: Premium content might be blocked
- **Rate limiting**: Some sites limit automated access
- **Geographic restrictions**: Regional content blocking

### Content Types
- **Dynamic content**: JavaScript-heavy sites might not load fully
- **PDF documents**: May have limited text extraction
- **Media files**: Images and videos are typically excluded
- **Large files**: Very large pages might be truncated

### Privacy and Security
- **Internal URLs**: Company-internal links won't be accessible
- **Sensitive content**: Be careful with confidential information
- **Malicious sites**: Avoid suspicious or harmful URLs

## Troubleshooting URL Mentions

### URL Not Loading
If `@https://example.com` doesn't work:
- Check if the URL is publicly accessible
- Verify the URL is correct and complete
- Try accessing the URL in your browser
- Check for authentication requirements

### Incomplete Content
If content seems limited:
- Try more specific page URLs
- Check if the page requires JavaScript
- Look for alternative documentation sources
- Use direct links to specific sections

### Slow Loading
If URL mentions are slow:
- Large pages take time to fetch
- Complex sites might have delays
- Try more specific URLs
- Consider breaking into smaller requests

URL mentions are powerful for bringing external knowledge into your conversations with Elastic, enabling you to reference documentation, issues, and learning resources directly in your development workflow.
