title: "Problem Mentions"
description: "Reference all workspace errors and warnings with complete diagnostic information"
---

Problem mentions let you reference all errors and warnings in your workspace using `@problems`. When you mention problems, Elastic sees the complete list of diagnostics with file locations, error messages, and severity levels.

## How Problem Mentions Work

When you type `@problems` in the chat input, Elastic automatically gathers:

- **All errors**: Critical issues that prevent compilation/execution
- **All warnings**: Potential issues that should be addressed
- **File locations**: Exact line and column numbers
- **Error messages**: Complete diagnostic information
- **Severity levels**: Error, warning, info, and hint classifications

## Syntax

```
@problems
```

Simple and straightforward - just type `@problems` and Elastic will include all current workspace diagnostics.

## What Elastic Sees

When you mention problems, Elastic receives:

1. **Complete error list** - Every diagnostic in your workspace
2. **File paths** - Exact location of each issue
3. **Line numbers** - Precise positioning information
4. **Error messages** - Full diagnostic descriptions
5. **Severity levels** - Priority and importance of each issue
6. **Error codes** - Specific diagnostic identifiers when available

## Best Practices

### When to Use Problem Mentions

- **Debugging sessions**: `@problems Help me fix all these errors`
- **Code review**: `@problems Are these warnings important?`
- **Before deployment**: `@problems Clean up before release`
- **Learning**: `@problems Explain what these errors mean`

### Combining with File Mentions

Target specific problematic files:

```
@problems @/src/auth.js 
Focus on the authentication errors
```

### Combining with Terminal Output

Get comprehensive debugging context:

```
@problems @terminal 
The build is failing and I'm seeing these errors
```

## Types of Problems Detected

### TypeScript/JavaScript Errors
- Type mismatches
- Missing imports
- Undefined variables
- Syntax errors

### Linting Issues
- ESLint violations
- Prettier formatting
- Custom rule violations
- Code style inconsistencies

### Build Errors
- Compilation failures
- Missing dependencies
- Configuration issues
- Asset problems

### Runtime Warnings
- Deprecated API usage
- Performance concerns
- Security vulnerabilities
- Best practice violations

## Problem Severity Levels

### Errors (Critical)
- **Red indicators**: Must be fixed
- **Block compilation**: Prevent builds
- **High priority**: Address immediately

### Warnings (Important)
- **Yellow indicators**: Should be fixed
- **Allow compilation**: Don't block builds
- **Medium priority**: Address when possible

### Info (Informational)
- **Blue indicators**: Good to know
- **Suggestions**: Improvements available
- **Low priority**: Address when convenient

### Hints (Subtle)
- **Gray indicators**: Minor suggestions
- **Optimizations**: Performance or style
- **Lowest priority**: Address if desired

## Tips for Effective Problem Mentions

1. **Regular checks**: Use `@problems` frequently during development
2. **Prioritize errors**: Fix errors before warnings
3. **Batch similar issues**: Group related problems together
4. **Understand context**: Ask Elastic to explain unfamiliar errors
5. **Prevent regression**: Check problems before committing code

## Integration with Memory Bank

Problem mentions help Elastic learn:

- **Common error patterns**: Mistakes you frequently make
- **Project-specific issues**: Recurring problems in your codebase
- **Resolution strategies**: How you prefer to fix certain errors
- **Code quality standards**: Your tolerance for different warning types

## Common Use Cases

### Debugging Session
```
@problems 
Help me understand and fix all these errors
```

### Code Quality Review
```
@problems 
Which of these warnings should I prioritize?
```

### Pre-commit Cleanup
```
@problems 
Clean up the codebase before I commit
```

### Learning and Understanding
```
@problems 
Explain what these TypeScript errors mean
```

### Batch Error Fixing
```
@problems 
Fix all the linting errors in one go
```

## Combining with Other Mentions

### With File Mentions
```
@problems @/src/components/Button.tsx 
Fix the errors in this specific component
```

### With Folder Mentions
```
@problems @/src/api/ 
Clean up all API-related errors
```

### With Terminal Output
```
@problems @terminal 
The build failed and I'm seeing these diagnostics
```

### With Git Changes
```
@problems @git-changes 
Make sure my recent changes don't introduce errors
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Problems Detected
If `@problems` shows no issues:
- Check if your IDE/editor is running diagnostics
- Verify language servers are active
- Ensure project is properly configured
- Try opening/saving files to trigger diagnostics

### Too Many Problems
If overwhelmed by problem count:
- Focus on errors first, then warnings
- Use file mentions to target specific areas
- Ask Elastic to prioritize the most critical issues
- Consider filtering by file or directory

### Missing Expected Problems
If you expect more problems:
- Check if all files are included in your project
- Verify linting and type checking are enabled
- Ensure all necessary extensions are installed
- Try restarting your language server

Problem mentions are essential for maintaining code quality and catching issues early in development, making them one of the most valuable mention types for debugging and code maintenance.
