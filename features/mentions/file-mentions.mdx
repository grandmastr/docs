File mentions let you reference any file in your workspace using `@/path/to/file` syntax. When you mention a file, Elastic sees the complete file content, including imports, related functions, and surrounding context.

## How File Mentions Work

When you type `@` in the chat input, Elastic shows you a searchable list of files in your workspace. You can:

- **Browse files**: Navigate through your project structure
- **Search files**: Type part of a filename to filter results
- **Select files**: Click or use keyboard navigation to select files

## Syntax

```
@/path/to/file.ext
```

Examples:
- `@/src/components/Button.tsx`
- `@/utils/helpers.js`
- `@/README.md`
- `@/package.json`

## What Elastic Sees

When you mention a file, Elastic receives:

1. **Complete file content** - Every line of code, comments, and formatting
2. **File path and name** - Full context of where the file lives
3. **File type information** - Language-specific understanding
4. **Import relationships** - Dependencies and connections to other files

## Best Practices

### When to Use File Mentions

- **Code review**: `@/src/auth.js Can you review this authentication logic?`
- **Bug investigation**: `@/components/Form.tsx This component is throwing errors`
- **Feature requests**: `@/api/users.js Add pagination to this endpoint`
- **Documentation**: `@/README.md Update the installation instructions`

### Multiple File Mentions

You can mention multiple files in a single message:

```
@/src/components/Button.tsx @/src/styles/button.css 
The button styling isn't being applied correctly
```

### Combining with Other Mentions

File mentions work great with other mention types:

```
@/src/api/auth.js @problems @terminal
The authentication is failing and I'm seeing errors
```

## File Types Supported

Elastic supports all file types in your workspace:

- **Code files**: `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.java`, `.cpp`, etc.
- **Configuration**: `.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.ini`, etc.
- **Documentation**: `.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`, etc.
- **Styles**: `.css`, `.scss`, `.less`, etc.
- **Data files**: `.csv`, `.xml`, `.sql`, etc.

## Tips for Effective File Mentions

1. **Be specific**: Mention the exact file you're asking about
2. **Use relative paths**: Start from your project root
3. **Include context**: Explain what you want to do with the file
4. **Combine strategically**: Use with folder mentions for broader context
5. **Check file size**: Very large files might be truncated in the response

## Integration with Memory Bank

File mentions integrate seamlessly with Elastic's Memory Bank:

- **Pattern recognition**: Elastic learns your coding patterns from mentioned files
- **Style consistency**: Maintains your coding style across similar files
- **Architecture understanding**: Builds knowledge of your project structure
- **Preference learning**: Remembers your preferred approaches and libraries

## Common Use Cases

### Code Analysis
```
@/src/utils/validation.js 
Can you explain how this validation logic works?
```

### Bug Fixing
```
@/components/UserProfile.tsx 
This component crashes when user data is null
```

### Feature Development
```
@/api/products.js 
Add search functionality to this products API
```

### Refactoring
```
@/legacy/old-auth.js @/modern/new-auth.js 
Help me migrate from the old auth system to the new one
```

File mentions are the foundation of precise, context-aware conversations with Elastic, enabling you to reference exactly what you're working on without copy-pasting code.
