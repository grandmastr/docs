Elastic Copilot's auto approve feature allows you to automatically approve and execute certain types of commands and code suggestions, streamlining your development workflow.

## How It Works

Auto approve enables Elastic Copilot to execute pre-approved actions without requiring manual confirmation for each operation. This feature is designed to speed up repetitive tasks while maintaining safety through configurable rules.

## Safety Features

### Built-in Protections

<Warning>
  **High-Risk Operations**: Auto approve never applies to operations that could cause data loss or security issues.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Audit Trail**: All auto-approved actions are logged for review and debugging purposes.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Gradual Enablement**: Start with conservative settings and gradually expand auto approve as you become comfortable with the feature.
