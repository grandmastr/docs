# Code Understanding

Elastic Copilot uses advanced tool-based analysis to understand your codebase without requiring manual indexing or setup. This intelligent system provides deep insights into your project structure, dependencies, and code patterns.

## How Code Understanding Works

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on pre-indexing, Elastic Copilot analyzes your code on-demand using a sophisticated tool system:

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Code Relationship Mapping

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import Analysis">
    Tracks how modules and files depend on each other
  </Step>
  <Step title="Function Calls">
    Maps function calls and method invocations across files
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Flow">
    Understands how data moves through your application
  </Step>
  <Step title="API Contracts">
    Identifies interfaces between different parts of your system
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tools Used for Analysis

Elastic Copilot employs several specialized tools for code understanding:

### File Operations
- **`read_file`** - Reads and analyzes individual files
- **`list_files`** - Explores directory structures
- **`search_files`** - Finds patterns and references across the codebase

### Code Analysis
- **`list_code_definition_names`** - Extracts functions, classes, and structures using tree-sitter
- **Tree-sitter parsing** - Language-specific syntax analysis
- **Dependency tracking** - Follows imports and module relationships

### Dynamic Exploration
- **On-demand loading** - Loads files only when needed for context
- **Smart caching** - Remembers analysis results during conversation
- **Context expansion** - Automatically includes related files when relevant

## Context-Aware Features

### Intelligent Code Completion

```javascript
// Elastic Copilot understands your project context
function calculateUserMetrics(user) {
  // It knows about your User model, database structure,
  // and existing analytics functions
  |
}
```

## Privacy and Performance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="On-Demand Analysis">
    - Files are analyzed only when you request assistance
    - No background scanning or indexing
    - Analysis results are cached only during active conversations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Selective Context">
    - Only relevant code sections are analyzed
    - You control what code is shared with AI models
    - Context is built incrementally as needed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Local Processing">
    - Tree-sitter parsing happens locally in VSCode
    - File reading and searching occur on your machine
    - Only necessary context is sent to AI models
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### Maximizing Understanding

<Tip>
  **Use descriptive file and function names** - This helps Elastic Copilot understand the purpose and context of your code.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Maintain clear project structure** - Well-organized projects are easier for AI to understand and navigate.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Include documentation** - README files, comments, and documentation help provide additional context.
</Tip>

### Working with Large Codebases

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Specific">
    Begin conversations with specific files or functions rather than asking about the entire project
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use @ Mentions">
    Use @ mentions to reference specific files, folders, and terminal output for focused context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build Incrementally">
    Ask follow-up questions to expand understanding to related areas
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Limitations and Considerations

<Warning>
  **Binary Files**: Elastic Copilot cannot analyze compiled binaries, images, or other non-text files.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Very Large Files**: Files over 10MB may have limited analysis to maintain performance.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Generated Code**: Auto-generated files (like bundled JavaScript) may provide less useful context than source files.
</Note>
