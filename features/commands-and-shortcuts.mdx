Elastic Copilot provides multiple ways to access its features through keyboard shortcuts, context menus, and the Command Palette. This guide covers all available commands and how to use them effectively.

## Core AI Commands

These are the primary AI-powered commands with dedicated keyboard shortcuts:

### Explain Code
- **Shortcut**: `Alt+Ctrl+N` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Ctrl+N` (Mac)
- **Function**: Analyzes and explains selected code or the current file
- **Usage**: Select code and press the shortcut, or use without selection to explain the entire file

### Fix Code
- **Shortcut**: `Alt+Ctrl+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Ctrl+X` (Mac)
- **Function**: Identifies and fixes issues in selected code
- **Usage**: Select problematic code and press the shortcut for AI-powered fixes

### Improve Code
- **Shortcut**: `Alt+Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Ctrl+I` (Mac)
- **Function**: Suggests improvements and optimizations for selected code
- **Usage**: Select code and press the shortcut to get enhancement suggestions

## Context Menu Commands

Right-click on code to access these commands when available:

### Code Analysis Commands
- **Explain with Elastic**: Available when code is selected
- **Fix with Elastic**: Available when code is selected
- **Improve with Elastic**: Available when code is selected

### Reference Commands
- **Add to References**: Available when a reference provider is active
- **Remove from References**: Available when a reference provider is active

These commands appear contextually based on:
- Whether code is selected
- Whether a reference provider is available
- Current editor state

## Command Palette Access

All Elastic Copilot commands are accessible through VS Code's Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`):

### Core Commands
- `Elastic: Explain Code`
- `Elastic: Fix Code`
- `Elastic: Improve Code`

### Interface Commands
- `Elastic: New Task` - Start a new conversation
- `Elastic: History` - View conversation history
- `Elastic: Account` - Manage account settings

### Advanced Commands
- `Elastic: Export Markdown` - Export conversations to markdown
- `Elastic: Open File` - Open files through AI assistance
- `Elastic: Extract Text` - Extract text from various sources

## Memory Bank Integration

Commands work seamlessly with Memory Bank features:

### Context-Aware Commands
- Commands automatically include relevant context from Memory Bank
- Active context templates enhance command responses
- Product and technical context inform AI responses

### Memory-Enhanced Shortcuts
- Keyboard shortcuts leverage stored project knowledge
- Commands adapt based on current project configuration
- Context switching affects command behavior

## MCP Tool Integration

Commands can utilize MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools:

### Enhanced Capabilities
- Commands may trigger MCP tool usage automatically
- External tool integration through MCP servers
- Extended functionality beyond core AI features

### Tool-Specific Commands
- Commands adapt when MCP tools are available
- Tool-specific shortcuts may become available
- Dynamic command enhancement based on connected tools

## Browser Integration

Commands work with browser functionality:

### Web-Enhanced Commands
- Commands can incorporate web research
- Browser session context affects responses
- URL content integration in command responses

## Best Practices

### Effective Usage
1. **Select Specific Code**: For targeted analysis, select the exact code you want to work with
2. **Use Context**: Commands work better with relevant context from Memory Bank
3. **Combine Commands**: Use multiple commands in sequence for comprehensive code improvement
4. **Leverage Shortcuts**: Keyboard shortcuts are faster than menu navigation

### Optimization Tips
1. **Configure Memory Bank**: Set up project context for better command responses
2. **Use MCP Tools**: Connect relevant tools to enhance command capabilities
3. **Maintain Context**: Keep related files open for better contextual understanding
4. **Review Suggestions**: Always review AI suggestions before implementing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Commands Not Appearing**
- Ensure Elastic Copilot is properly installed and activated
- Check that you're in a supported file type
- Verify code selection if using selection-based commands

**Keyboard Shortcuts Not Working**
- Check for conflicting key bindings in VS Code settings
- Ensure the extension is active and properly loaded
- Restart VS Code if shortcuts stop responding

**Context Menu Missing**
- Right-click directly on selected code
- Ensure code is properly selected
- Check that the file type is supported

### Performance Optimization
- Use specific code selections rather than entire files when possible
- Ensure Memory Bank is properly configured for your project
- Keep related context files accessible for better responses

## Customization

### Key Bindings
You can customize keyboard shortcuts in VS Code:
1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Search for "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts"
3. Search for "Elastic" commands
4. Modify shortcuts as needed

### Context Menu
Context menu items are automatically managed based on:
- Current selection state
- Available reference providers
- Active MCP tools
- Extension configuration

The Commands & Shortcuts system provides flexible access to Elastic Copilot's powerful AI features, ensuring you can work efficiently with your preferred interaction method.
