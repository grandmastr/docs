## Custom Tool Development

Create your own tools using the MCP framework:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design Tool Interface">
    Define what your tool should do and what parameters it needs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Tool Logic">
    Write the actual functionality using your preferred language
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create MCP Server">
    Package your tool as an MCP server following the protocol specification
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Integration">
    Add your custom server to Elastic Copilot's MCP settings
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tool Selection Logic

Elastic Copilot intelligently chooses tools based on context:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Context-Driven" icon="brain">
    Tools are selected based on the type of assistance requested and available context
  </Card>
  <Card title="Efficiency-Focused" icon="gauge">
    Most efficient tools are chosen first, with fallbacks for complex scenarios
  </Card>
  <Card title="Permission-Aware" icon="shield">
    Tools respect user permissions and approval settings
  </Card>
  <Card title="Error-Resilient" icon="life-ring">
    Backup strategies when primary tools fail or are unavailable
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Performance Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Caching">
    - File analysis results are cached during conversations
    - Tree-sitter parsing results are reused when possible
    - MCP server connections are pooled for efficiency
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Lazy Loading">
    - Tools are loaded only when needed
    - File reading happens on-demand
    - Large file processing is optimized for performance
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Resource Management">
    - Terminal processes are managed to prevent resource leaks
    - Browser automation sessions are properly cleaned up
    - Database connections are pooled and reused
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security and Privacy

<Warning>
  **Tool Access**: Tools have access to your local file system and can execute commands. Review tool operations before granting permissions.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local Tools">
    File operations and code analysis happen entirely on your machine. No code is sent to external services without explicit action.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="External Integrations">
    MCP tools that connect to external services use your provided credentials and follow each service's security guidelines.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Approval System">
    Configure auto-approval settings for trusted operations, or review each tool operation manually.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
